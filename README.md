This repository contains the Android apk file which can be installed directly on your device to run the E-Learning app.

If installed, the application should be run in the device light mode theme. As Firebase can act somewhat slow on emulators, it is advised that the app apk file be run on a real device running Android 8 to 13 (API 26 - 33).
